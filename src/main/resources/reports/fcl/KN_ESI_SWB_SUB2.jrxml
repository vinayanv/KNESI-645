contained in this sea waybill.
3. CARRIER’S TARIFF
3.1 The provisions of the Carrier’s applicable tariff, if any, are incorporated herein. Particular attention is drawn to the provisions therein, if any, relating to
free storage time and to Container and vehicle demurrage. Copies of such provisions are obtainable from the Carrier or his agents upon request or, where
applicable, from a government body with whom the tariff has been filed. In the case of inconsistency between this sea waybill and the applicable tariff, this

4. NON-NEGOTIABILITY
Notwithstanding the application to this sea waybill of the Hague Rules, or the Hague-Visby Rules, or of any similar convention or legislation, this sea waybill
is not negotiable and is not a document of title to the Goods.
5. SUB-CONTRACTING AND INDEMNITIES
5.1 The Carrier shall be entitled to sub-contract on any terms whatsoever the whole or any part of the Carriage and the Merchant agrees (to the extent that
the Merchant is entitled to bring claims against Sub-Contractors) that any Sub-Contractor can, at its option, apply its own terms of contract with the Carrier to
defend claims brought by the Merchant.
5.2 The Merchant undertakes:
(a) that no claim or allegation shall be made against any Sub-Contractor whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, which imposes or attempts to impose
upon any Sub-Contractor any liability whatsoever in connection with the Goods or the Carriage of the Goods, whether or not arising in contract, bailment,
tort, negligence, breach of express or implied warranty or otherwise; and

including clause 21 hereof, the jurisdiction and law clause, as if this sea waybill (including Clause 21 hereof) were expressly for its benefit and in entering into
this contract the Carrier, to the extent of these provisions, does so not only on his own behalf but also as agent or trustee for such Sub-Contractor and such
Sub-Contractor shall to this extent be or be deemed to be parties to this contract.
6. CARRIER'S LIABILITY
6.1 US CARRIAGE
(a) For US Carriage this sea waybill shall have effect subject to the provisions of COGSA and to the Pomerene Act regardless of whether said Act would
apply of its own force. The provisions of COGSA are incorporated herein and save as otherwise provided herein shall apply the entire time the Goods are in
the Carrier's custody, including before loading and after discharge as long as the Goods remain in the custody of the Carrier or its Sub-Contractor, including
Goods carried on deck. Nothing contained herein is to be deemed as surrender by the Carrier of its rights, immunities, exemptions or limitations or an
increase of any of its responsibilities or liabilities under COGSA. Except for clause 6.2, every other term, condition, limitation, defence and liberty whatsoever
contained in this sea waybill shall apply to US Carriage.
(b) Where the Merchant requests the Carrier to procure Carriage by an inland carrier in the United States of America, such Carriage shall be procured by the
Carrier as agent only to the Merchant and such Carriage shall be subject to the inland carrier’s own contractual conditions and tariff. If, for any reason, the
Carrier is denied the right to act as agent only at these times, his liability for loss, damage or delay to the Goods shall be determined in accordance with
clause 6 hereof.
(c) Neither the Carrier nor the Vessel shall in any event be or become liable in an amount exceeding US$500 per package or customary freight unit. For
limitation purposes under COGSA, it is agreed that the meaning of the word "package" shall be any palletised and/or unitised assemblage of cartons which
has been palletised and/or unitised for the convenience of the Merchant, regardless of whether said pallet or unit is disclosed on the front hereof.
6.2 NON-US CARRIAGE
(a) Where the Non US Carriage is Port to Port Transport:
(i) the period of responsibility of the Carrier for any loss or damage to the Goods shall commence only at the moment the Goods are loaded on board the
Vessel and shall end when the Goods have been discharged from the Vessel.
(ii) the liability of the Carrier for loss of or damage to the Goods shall be determined in accordance with any national law making the Hague Rules or Hague-
Visby Rules compulsorily applicable to bills of lading and if no such national law is compulsorily applicable, then in accordance with the Hague-Visby Rules
Article 1-8 inclusive (excluding Article 3 rule 8).
(iii) the Carrier shall be under no liability whatsoever for loss or damage to the Goods while in its actual or constructive possession before loading or after
discharge, howsoever caused. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case and to the extent that any applicable compulsory law provides to the contrary, the
Carrier shall have the benefit of every right, defence, limitation and liberty in the Hague Rules, Hague-Visby Rules, or any other rules as applied by clause (b)
during such additional compulsory period of responsibility, notwithstanding that the loss or damage did not occur at sea.
(iv) if the Goods are discharged at a port other than the Port of Discharge or at a Place of Delivery instead of the Port of Discharge, and the Carrier in its
absolute discretion agrees to a request to such effect, such further Carriage will be undertaken on the basis that this sea waybill is to apply to such Carriage
as if the ultimate destination agreed with the Merchant had been entered on the front side of this sea waybill as the Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery.
(b) Where the Non US Carriage is Multimodal Transport and the Merchant can prove at what stage the loss or damage occurred:
(i) the liability of the Carrier shall be deter¬mined by the provisions contained in any international convention or national law, which applies compulsorily to
the relevant stage of the Multimodal Transport and cannot be departed from by private contract to the detriment of the claimant; and
(ii) where an international convention or national law does not apply compulsorily to the stage of the movement where the loss or damage occurred, any
liability of the Carrier shall be determined by sub-clause 6.2(c).
(c) Where the Non US Carriage is Multimodal Transport but the Merchant cannot prove at what stage the loss or damage occurred or if this sub-clause
applies pursuant to sub-clause 6.2(b):
(i) the Carrier shall be relieved of liability for any loss or damage if such loss or damage arose or resulted from:
(A) the wrongful act or neglect of the Merchant or any Person acting on behalf of the Merchant other than the Carrier or its servant, agent or Sub-Contractor;
(B) compliance with the instructions of a Person entitled to give them;
(C) the lack of, or defective condition of packing in the case of Goods which, by their nature, are liable to wastage or to be da¬maged when not packed or
when not properly packed;
(D) handling, loading, stowage or unloading of the Goods by the Merchant, or any person acting on behalf of the Merchant;
(E) inherent vice of the Goods;
(F) insufficiency or inadequacy of marks or numbers on the Goods, coverings, or unit loads;
(G) strikes or lockouts or stoppage or restraint of labour from whatever cause whether partial or general;
(H) an act, neglect or default in the navigation or management of the Vessel occurring during carriage by water;
(I) fire, unless the fire was caused by the actual fault or privity of the Carrier or lack of exercise of due diligence to make the Vessel seaworthy, properly to
man, equip and supply the Vessel or to make her fit and safe for the reception, carriage and preservation of the Goods; for which the Merchant shall have the
burden of proof
(J) a nuclear incident;
(K) any other cause or event which the Carrier could not avoid and the consequences whereof it could not prevent by the exercise of reasonable diligence.
(ii) The burden of proof that the loss or damage was due to one or more of the causes, or events, specified in sub-clause 6.2(c)(i) shall rest upon the Carrier.
When the Carrier establishes that in the circumstances of the case, the loss or damage could be attributed to one or more of the causes, or events, specified
in sub-clause 6.2(c)(i), it shall be presumed that it was so caused. The claimant shall, however, be entitled to prove that the loss or damage was not, in fact,
caused either wholly or partly by one or more of these causes or events.
(iii) Where the loss or damage was partly caused by one of the causes at sub-clause 6.2(c)(i) the Carrier shall only be liable to the extent that another cause
contributed to the loss or damage.
(d) Compensation and Limitation
(i) Subject to the Carrier’s right to limit liability as provided for within this sea waybill, the Carrier’s liability shall be calculated by reference to the value of the
Goods at the place and time at which they were accepted for Carriage.
(ii) Where the Hague Rules, Hague-Visby Rules or any other rules compulsorily apply to the Carriage the Carrier’s liability shall in no event exceed the
amounts provided for in the applicable rules.
(iii) In all other cases compensation shall not exceed the limitation of liability of 2SDRs per kilo of gross weight of the Goods lost, damaged or in respect of
which the claim arises.
(e) Time-bar
(i) Where the Hague Rules, Hague-Visby Rules or any other rules apply compulsorily to the Carriage, the time limit for bringing claims will be as prescribed
by the applicable rules.
(ii) In all other cases, the Carrier shall be discharged of all liability whatsoever unless suit is brought within nine months after the delivery of the Goods or the
date when the Goods should have been delivered.
6.3 LIABILITY APPLICABLE TO BOTH US CARRIAGE AND NON-US CARRIAGE
(a) The Carrier shall not, in any case, be liable for an amount greater than the actual loss to the Person entitled to make the claim.
(b) Ad Valorem: declared value of Package or shipping unit.
The Carrier’s liability may be increased to a higher value by a declaration in writing of the value of the Goods by the Merchant upon delivery to the Carrier of
the Goods for shipment, such higher value being inserted on the front of this sea waybill in the space provided and, if required by the Carrier, extra freight
being paid. In such case, if the actual value of the Goods shall exceed such declared value, the value shall nevertheless be deemed to be the declared value
and the Carrier’s liability, if any, shall not exceed the declared value and any partial loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata on the basis of such declared
value.
(c) Delay, Consequential Loss
Save as otherwise provided herein, the Carrier does not undertake that the Goods shall arrive at any place at any particular time and shall in no
circumstances be liable for direct, indirect or consequential loss or damage caused by delay or any other cause whatsoever and howsoever caused. Without
prejudice to the foregoing, if the Carrier is found liable for delay, liability shall be limited to the Freight applicable to the relevant stage of the transport.
(d) Notice of Loss or Damage
The Carrier shall be deemed prima facie to have delivered the Goods as described in this sea waybill unless notice of loss of, or damage to, the Goods,
indicating the general nature of such loss or damage, shall have been given in writing to the Carrier or to his representative at the place of delivery before or
at the time of removal of the Goods into the custody of the Person entitled to delivery thereof under this sea waybill or, if the loss or damage is not apparent,
within three consecutive days thereafter.
(e) The defences and limits of liability provided for in this sea waybill shall apply in any action against the Carrier whether the action be found in contract,
bailment, tort, breach of express or implied warranty or otherwise.
(f) The Merchant shall Indemnify the Carrier against any claim or liability (and any expense arising therefrom) arising from the Carriage of the Goods insofar
as such claim or liability exceeds the Carrier’s liability under this sea waybill.
7. MERCHANT'S WARRANTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
7.1 Every Person defined as Merchant is jointly and severally liable to the Carrier for all the Merchant's undertakings, responsibilities and liabilities under or in
connection with this sea waybill and to pay the Freight due under it without deduction or set-off.
7.2 The Merchant warrants that in agreeing to this sea waybill he is or is the agent of and has the authority of the Person owning or entitled to the possession
of the Goods and this sea waybill or any Person who has a present or future interest in the Goods and this sea waybill.
7.3 The description and particulars of the Goods and Container set out on the face hereof are furnished by the Merchant and the Merchant warrants to the
Carrier that the description and particulars including, but not limited to, verified gross mass, weight, content, measure, quantity, quality, condition, marks,
numbers and value are correct.
7.4 The Merchant shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations and requirements (including but not limited to any imposed at any time before or during
the Carriage relating to anti-terrorism measures) of customs, port and other authorities and shall bear and pay all duties, taxes, fines, imposts, expenses and
losses (including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, freight for any additional Carriage undertaken) incurred or suffered by reason thereof or
by reason of any illegal, incorrect or insufficient marking, numbering or addressing of the Goods.
7.5 The Merchant undertakes that the Goods are packed in a manner adequate to withstand the ordinary risks of Carriage having regard to their nature and
in compliance with all laws, regulations and requirements which may be applicable. The Merchant shall be liable for any loss, damage or injury caused by
faulty or insufficient packing or by faulty loading or packing within Containers when such loading or packing has been performed by the Merchant or an
behalf of the Merchant, or by the defect or unsuitability of the Containers when supplied by the Merchant, and shall Indemnify the Carrier against any
additional expenses so caused.
7.6 Any Container released into the care of the Merchant for packing, unpacking or any other purpose whatsoever shall be at the sole risk of the Merchant
until proper redelivery to the Carrier at the time and place prescribed by the Carrier. If the Merchant fails to deliver the Container at such prescribed time and
place, the Merchant shall pay the Carrier the applicable demurrage or detention charges arising therefrom. The Merchant is responsible for returning the
empty Container, with interiors brushed and clean, to the point or place designated by the Carrier, his servants or agents. The Merchant shall be liable for
any charges, loss or any other expenses arising therefrom. The Merchant shall be responsible for any loss and/or damage to, and any liabilities caused or
incurred by such Container whilst in its custody and/or control.
7.7 The Merchant shall be liable for the loss, damage, contamination, soiling, detention or demurrage before, during and after the Carriage of property
(including, but not limited to, Containers) of the Carrier or Sub-Contractor (other than the Merchant) caused by the Merchant or any Person acting on his
behalf or for which the Merchant is otherwise responsible.]]></text>

				<text><![CDATA[7.8 The Merchant shall Indemnify the Carrier against any loss, damage, claim, liability or expense whatsoever arising from any breach of the provisions of
this clause 7 or from any cause in connection with the Goods for which the Carrier is not responsible.
8. DANGEROUS GOODS
8.1 No Goods which are or may become dangerous (whether or not so listed in codes), inflammable, damaging, injurious (including radioactive materials),
noxious or which are or may become liable to damage any property or Person whatsoever shall be tendered to the Carrier for Carriage without:
(a) the Carrier’s express consent in writing; and
(b) the Container and/or other covering in which the Goods are to be transported and/or the Goods themselves being distinctly marked on the outside so as
to indicate the nature and character of any such Goods and so as to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and/or requirements.
8.2 If the Merchant fails to provide such information and the Carrier is unaware of the dangerous nature of the Goods and the necessary precautions to be
taken and if, at any time, they are deemed to be a hazard to life or property, they may at any place be unloaded, destroyed or rendered harmless, as
circumstances may require, without compensation, and the Merchant shall be liable for all loss, damage, delay or expenses arising from the Carriage. The
burden of proof that the Carrier knew the exact nature of the danger constituted by the carriage of the Goods shall rest upon the Merchant.
8.3 The Merchant shall comply with rules which are mandatory according to the national law or by reason of international convention, relating to the carriage
of Goods of a dangerous nature. If any Goods shipped with the knowledge of the Carrier as to their dangerous nature shall became a danger to the ship or
cargo, they may in like manner be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the Carrier without liability on the part of the Carrier except to
General Average, if any.
8.4 The Merchant shall Indemnify the Carrier against any loss, damage, claim, liability or expense whatsoever arising from any breach of the provisions of
this clause 8 or from any cause in connection with the Goods for which the Carrier is not responsible.
9. CONTAINERS
9.1 Goods may be Consolidated by the Carrier in or on Containers and Goods may be Consolidated with Goods owned by other Persons.
9.2 The terms of this sea waybill shall govern the responsibility of the Carrier in connection with or arising out of the supply of a Container to the Merchant,
whether supplied before or after the Goods are received by the Carrier or delivered to the Merchant.
9.3 If a Container has been Consolidated by or on behalf of the Merchant, the Carrier shall not be liable for loss of or damage to the Goods:
(a) caused by the manner in which the Container has been stuffed;
(b) caused by the unsuitability of the Goods for carriage in Container actually used;
(c) caused by the unsuitability or defective condition of the Container actually used provided that where the Container has been supplied by or on behalf of
the Carrier, this paragraph (iii) shall only apply if the unsuitability or defective condition would have been apparent upon reasonable inspection by the
Merchant at or prior to the time when the Container was stuffed;
(d) if the Container is not sealed at the commencement of the Carriage except where the Carrier has agreed to seal the Container.
9.4 Where the Carrier is instructed to provide a Container, in the absence of a written request to the contrary accepted by the Carrier, the Carrier is not under
an obligation to provide a Container of any particular type or quality.
9.5 Goods stowed in closed containers other than flats or pallets, whether by the Carrier or the Merchant, may be carried on deck, on an open lorry, on an

the Carriage and/or to store the Goods ashore or afloat, under cover or in the open, at any place, whichever the Carrier in his absolute discretion considers

(c) transfer the Goods from one conveyance to another including transshipping or carrying the same on a Vessel other than the Vessel named on the front

whether carried on deck or under deck shall participate in General Average and, subject to Clause 13.3, such Goods shall be deemed to be within the
definition of Goods for the purposes of the Hague Rules or any legislation making such rules, COGSA or the Hague-Visby Rules compulsorily applicable to
this sea waybill.
13.3 Goods which are stated on the front of this sea waybill to be carried on deck, and which are actually carried on deck, are carried without responsibility
on the part of the Carrier for loss or damage of whatsoever nature arising during Carriage by sea or inland waterway whether caused by unseaworthiness or
negligence or any other cause whatsoever.
14. COLLECTION AND DELIVERY OF THE GOODS
14.1 When collection or delivery takes place at the Merchant's premises, the place of collection or delivery shall be the usual place of loading or unloading
the Goods into or from the vehicle and:
(a) the Carrier shall not be under any obligation to provide any plant, power or labour which may be required for the loading or unloading at such premises.
This shall be the responsibility of the Merchant at his own risk and expense.

(a) without notice to the Merchant abandon the Carriage of the Goods and where reasonably possible place the Goods or any part of them at the Merchant’s
disposal at any place which the Carrier may deem safe and convenient, notwithstanding that any charges, dues or other expenses may be or become
payable. If crafts are used, other than at the request of the Merchant, in circumstances where the Goods or that part thereof so discharged could have been
discharged ashore without additional delay, the Goods (or part thereof, as the case may be) shall nevertheless not be deemed to be discharged for the
purposes of this clause until they are discharged from such craft, whereupon delivery shall be deemed to have been made and the responsibility of the
Carrier in respect of such Goods shall cease;
(b) without prejudice to the Carrier’s right to subsequently abandon the Carriage under Clause (a)14.2 (a) above, continue the Carriage.
(c) In any event the Carrier shall be entitled to full Freight on Goods received for Carriage and the Merchant shall pay any additional costs resulting from the
above mentioned circumstances.
14.3 The liability of the Carrier in respect of the Goods shall cease on the delivery or other disposition of the Goods in accordance with the orders or
recommendations given by any government or authority or any Person acting or purporting to act as or on behalf of such government or authority. This shall
amount to due delivery to the Merchant.
14.4 Any mention herein of parties to be notified of the arrival of the Goods is solely for information of the Carrier, and failure to give such notification shall
not involve the Carrier in any liability nor relieve the Merchant of any obligation thereunder.
14.5 Should the Shipper request the Carrier to deliver the Goods to a Person other than the Consignee named on the front hereof, agreement to such
change shall be at the Carrier's sole discretion and the Carrier shall in any event not accept such change, unless the Shipper's request is in writing and it is
received by the Carrier in good time before notice of arrival of the Goods has been sent out by the Carrier's agent at destination. The Shipper hereby
undertakes to Indemnify the Carrier against any additional costs, expenses, delays and losses caused thereby.
14.6 If delivery of the Goods or any part thereof is not taken by the Merchant at the time and place when and where the Carrier is entitled to call upon the
Merchant to take delivery thereof, the Carrier shall be entitled and without prejudice to any other rights that he may have against the Merchant without notice
to remove from a Container the Goods or that part thereof if Consolidated in or on a Container and to store the Goods or that part thereof ashore, afloat, in
the open or under cover at the sole risk and expense of the Merchant and the costs of such storage (if paid or payable by the Carrier or any agent or Sub-
Contractor of the Carrier) shall forthwith upon demand be paid by the Merchant to the Carrier. Such storage shall constitute due delivery hereunder, and
thereupon the liability of the Carrier in respect of the Goods or that part thereof shall cease.

charges thereon shall, if required be submitted to the Carrier prior to delivery of the Goods.
16.4 The Carrier shall be under no obligation to take any steps whatsoever to collect security for General Average contributions due to the Merchant.
17. FREIGHT
17.1 Freight shall be deemed fully earned upon receipt of the Goods by the Carrier and shall be paid and be non-returnable in any event.
17.2 The Merchant's attention is drawn to the stipulations concerning currency in which the Freight is to be paid, rate of exchange, devaluation and other
contingencies relative to Freight in the relevant tariff conditions. If no such stipulation as to devaluation exists or is applicable and if the currency in which the
Freight is quoted is devalued or revalued between the date of the Freight agreement and the date when the Freight is paid, then all Freight shall be
automatically and immediately changed in proportion to the extent of the devaluation or revaluation of the said currency. Payment shall be made in the
currency named in the sea waybill, or, at the option of the Carrier, in another currency specified by the Carrier.
17.3 The Freight has been calculated on the basis of particulars furnished by or on behalf of the Merchant. The Carrier shall be entitled to production of the
commercial invoice for the Goods or true copy thereof and to inspect, reweigh, re-measure and revalue the Goods and if the particulars are found by the
Carrier to be incorrect, it is agreed that without prejudice to the rights of the Carrier as per clause 11 a sum equal either to five times the difference between
the correct Freight and the Freight charged or to double the correct Freight less the Freight charged, whichever sum is the smaller, shall be payable as
liquidated damages to the Car¬rier, notwithstanding any other sum having been stated in this sea waybill as the Freight payable.
17.4 All Freight shall be paid without any set-off, counter-claim, deduction or stay of execution.
17.5 Despite the acceptance by the Carrier of instructions to collect Freight or other expenses from any other Person in respect of the transport under this
sea waybill, the Merchant shall remain responsible for such monies on receipt of evidence of demand and the absence of payment for whatever reason.
17.6 All dues, taxes and charges levied on the Goods and other expenses in connection therewith shall be paid by the Merchant.
17.7 The Merchant shall reimburse the Carrier for any costs for deviation or delay or any other increase of costs of whatever nature caused by war, warlike
operations, epidemics, strikes, government directions or force majeure.
18. LIEN
18.1 The Carrier shall have a lien on Goods and any documents relating thereto for all sums whatsoever due at any time to the Carrier under this sea waybill
and for General Average contributions to whomsoever due.
18.2 The Carrier shall also have a lien on the Goods and any documents relating thereto for all sums due from the Merchant to the Carrier under any other
contract.
18.3 The Carrier may exercise his lien at any time and at any place in his sole discretion, whether the Carriage is completed or not. In any event any lien
shall (a) survive the delivery of the Goods and (b) extend to cover the cost of recovering any sums due.
18.4 To enforce and satisfy the Carrier's lien, the Carrier shall have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of the aforementioned Goods and documents by
public auction or private treaty at the Merchant’s expense and in the Merchant’s name and without any liability towards the Merchant, provided that the
Carrier has used reasonable efforts to notify the shipper and the consignee shown on the front side of the sea waybill prior to any sale or other disposal and
that the Carrier will pass on to the Merchant any proceeds of a sale or other disposal exceeding the sums due and the costs relating to the sale or other
disposal.

invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such provision. The validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby and this sea waybill
contract shall be carried out as if such invalid or unenforceable provision was not contained herein.
